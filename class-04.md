#### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

the <a> element.

#### The href attribute contains what information?

Href, which means Hypertext Reference, contains the URL of the webpage that the text will take you to.

#### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

Ensure the description of what the link is, and where it goes, is in the link itself. Screenreaders are capable of hopping between links on a page, so being able to understand what the link is out of context of the rest is valuble.

#### What is meant by “normal flow”?

Normal flow is the *default* way in which CSS lays out the various aspects of the page when no CSS styling is applied. As an example, with normal flow links are blue, and become purple if the page has been visited. Normal flow can be entirely removed.

#### What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

Inline elements are contained within block-level elements in CSS. Block elements take up a "stacked box" of space, from one side of the screen to the other, while inline can be a single word inside a paragraph of text with it's own formatting. <Span> is an inline element. <p> is a block element.

#### ___ positioning is the default for every html element

Static.

#### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element

Absolute positioning gives you perfect control over where a normally stacked box element should go. If you have a box element at the bottom of your CSS and HTML in absolute mode, and positioned just 10 pixels from top and right, it will be at the very top of the page, and overlapping anything already there!

#### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

Fixed positioning maintains an absolute position *relative to the viewport.* Which means that if you scroll down or up any amount, the element will stay visible on screen, and indeed, not move at all.

#### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation

A function declaration is where you "create" the function, describing the details of how the function will work, and any arguments it will be able to take.

A function invocation is the act of "using" the function. Calling it, providing it with arguments (if applicable,) and having it execute the previously declared steps.

#### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

According to the Functions page present on the Mozilla Development Network, they both refer to the same thing.

#### Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey

Social Skills: There's a reason I decided to get a degree in communication. I can present to a group, or in front of a class without issue, but talking through, and working on projects as "me" can sometimes result in me stammering and freezing up. This assignment is actually quite scary for me.

Work Environment Readiness: As an extension of the above, I suppose it's better I rip the bandage off here in this class, as opposed to the first day on a job. Because being thrown into pair programming for the first time as part of a new job, an event already full of extremely new experiences, would be, well. Terrifying.
