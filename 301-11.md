## MongoDB and Mongoose

### nosql vs sql

#### Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases

SQL:
1 Table based
2 does not support dynamic and unstructured data
3 Has a strict standard schema that it follows
4 Vertically scalable.
NoSQL:
1 Document/keyvalue pairs/wide-column stores based
2 Supports unstructured data
3 has a loose schema that can dynamically change
4 Horizontally scalable.

#### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

Transactional information, in large amounts.

#### Give a real world example.

A full database of all bank members' transactions for the month.

#### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

Submitted forms and potentially arbitrarily formatted documents.

#### Give a real world example

An archive of a company's RMA warranty requests.

#### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL

#### Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL for vertical scaling.
NoSQL for horizontal scaling.

### sql vs nosql (video)

#### What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

#### What is a relational database?

A database where one table has information, a second table has other information, and an index id pair one from each in a third table, that links table one to table two.

#### What type of structure does a relational database work with?

One to One, One to Many, or Many to Many.

#### What is a ‘schema’?

"A list of logical structures of data." Kind of like an array of objects. A rigid schema allows you to be sure that you will find a result from a search.

#### What is a NoSQL database?

A non schema limited database, like MongoDB uses. 

#### How does it work?

MongoDB keeps its data within collections of documents instead of the typical tables and rows of data that SQL does.

#### What is inside of a MongoDB database?

Usually a few nested collections of data. Key value pairs.

#### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB

#### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

You cannot be certain that a specific entry will be filled, and relational data needs to be filled manually. Decent chance of duplicate information.
