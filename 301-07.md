## REST

### How I explained REST to my brother

#### Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy Fielding is a co-creator of some of the first web servers in the world, including being credited for making the HTTP protocol.

#### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

"Machines don't have a universal noun," in that each programming language is different and expects you to format requests or actions in ways that match their language.

#### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

Representational State Transfer. REST.

#### What does a GET do?

GET will request the resources that a webpage has, and is noun agnostic. GET can GET an image or a video or a block of text.

#### What does a POST do?

Adds a new item into another system. New entry.

#### What does PUT do?

Adds a new item into another system, in the place of an existing one. Replace entry.

#### What does PATCH do?

Append another bit of data to an existing item. expand on an existing entry.
