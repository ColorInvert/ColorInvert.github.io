### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

#### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

Increased Efficiency: Research has found that pair programming is nearly as efficient as two people programming individually, but also results in less bugs, preventing issues later on.

Increased Focus: Having someone to bounce off of and speak with while you both work makes sure that you're staying engaged.

Learning from Others: Your pair might come up with a simple solution you had no idea existed, and you may do the same for them, which makes you both better programmers for knowing new solutions to problems.

Social skill: Pair programming means you're always talking. Practicing social skills simply comes with the territory of undertaking pair programming.

Job Interview Preparedness: Many job interviews involve you doing pair programming with an existing employee to gauge you skill at working with the existing team.

Work Preparedness: Many programming jobs start with pair programming, as you will often be put into responsibility of an existing system, so a trained employee will have to show you how things work, which necessitates a pair programming session.

#### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Learning from others. It's definitely possible for me to end up as the queen of inefficiency in various programming problems, so it's good for me to have someone to talk out my solutions to problems with.

#### How does pair programming work?

Two people at the same computer, working on the same code. One driver, one navigator. Driver being the person typing the code, navigator working out the logic and instructing them on what actions to take and what approaches.
