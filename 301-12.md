## CRUD

### Status Codes Based On REST Methods

#### In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

#### 100’s =

Informational. Here's some information on what you're trying to do, and what the server is doing. We will try to make this work.

#### 200’s =

Success. Note that this is success of *receiving* the request, not necessarily that the request will be completed as the client has requested.

#### 300’s =

Redirection. The request your making doesn't go to this endpoint any more, try another request over here instead.

#### 400’s =

Client error. Invalid request from the client to the server, such as malformation of request, or timeout. Check your request again to make sure it's valid.

#### 500’s =

Sever error. You sent a valid request, but the server is unable at this time to comply with it. Overloaded server, or an internal crash of the server can cause this.

#### What is a status code 202?

Accepted. Used for asynchronous processing. Your requested information will be delivered soon.

#### What is a status code 308?

Permanent redirect. Don't use this endpoint anymore, instead use the following.

#### What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

501, not implemented, or 500, server error.

#### What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

Typically 404, but 410 can also be used.

#### What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?

Code 403.

### Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick - First 20 minutes

#### Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?

To keep it private and locally locked.

#### What is middleware?

Another file in your directory that your application requires in order to function correctly.

#### What does app.use(express.json()) do?

It lets your server accept JSON commands.

#### What does the /:id mean in a route?

It means that this route is a parameter that can be received by the server.

#### What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?

PUT will update the entire object inside the database. PATCH allows you to add or modify a single key value pair without changing the rest of it.

#### How do you make a default value in a schema?

the following formatting.

```

name: {
  type: String,
  required: true
}


```

Give the name of they key, give the datatype of the value, and if it is mandatory.

#### What does a 500 error status code mean?

Internal Server Error. "Something went wrong, and we don't have a more specific error message to provide you."

#### What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?

200 is a standard "All is good, here you go" while 201 is specifically "All is good, and what you've requested be created, has been."
