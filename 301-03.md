## Passing Functions as Props

### React Docs - lists and keys

#### What does .map() return?
An array that contains each element modified by the defined callback function passed into map().

#### If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
After the array is created, when it comes time to display, put the array in curly braces.

#### Each list item needs a unique ____.
Key.

#### What is the purpose of a key?
To maintain a stable unchanging component state that can be latched onto. Helps React know what is being modified.

### The Spread Operator

#### What is the spread operator?
The spread operator is ... and will "explode" or "spread" an array into its individual elements when passed into a function. An example of when this is useful would be having a large array of numbers, trying to find the biggest individual number present, and passing it into a function that is expecting the individual numbers as arguments, and not an array.

the Spread operator means that the following:   biggest( ... [2, 6, 4, 9, 2]) is functionally identical to    biggest(2, 6, 4, 9, 2)


#### List 4 things that the spread operator can do

Math functions against an array input
Concatenation
Adding something to state in React
Adding an item to a list

#### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays

arrayA = [1, 2, 3]
arrayB = [4, 5, 6]

arrayC = [... arrayA, ... arrayB]

arrayC will then become [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

#### Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array

arrayA = [1, 2, 3]

arrayC = [0, ... arrayA, 4, 5]

arrayC will then become [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,]

#### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one

objectA = {Coolness : 10}

objectB = {Practicality : 2}

objectC = {...objectA, ...objectB}

objectC will then have both keyvalue pairs coolness : 10 and Practicality : 2.

### Videos: How to Pass Functions Between Components

#### In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

Defines the function, and then passes the function down as a prop.

#### In your own words, what does the increment function do?

Receives a name, uses map to search through the existing people objects array for a matching name. If found, increment the value for that object, and destroy the previous version of the array of people objects by overwriting it with the newly incremented one.

#### How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

passes the method down to the child as a prop.

#### How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

this.props.methodName(), assuming it has been correctly passed in as a prop.
