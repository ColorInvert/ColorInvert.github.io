## More CRUD

### CRUD Basics


#### Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

PUT.

#### Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

PUT and DELETE. (READ can use an ID, but does not require it.)

#### Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

REST is the method and formatting for commands that computers can use to communicate with each other. The client/server communication. CRUD can exist *within* a REST environment, but is a function for databases, not a client/server handshake.

#### If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

import express and cors.
set up route commands, each with a /domain and taking the arguments (req,res,next)
create functions that handle a GET request to your routes, a PUT request, a DELETE request, and a READ request.
Ensure that IDs can be passed into the end of your / routes for PUT and DELETE to know what to modify.
set a localhost port in your ENV file, and run nodemon to get it hosted on localhost:YOURPORT.
