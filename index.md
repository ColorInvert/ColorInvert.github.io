## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Growth Mindset is a concept and belief that instead of talent being innate and fixed, that people who practice and stick to doing something with the intent to learn and master will continue to improve and grow in their skill at the task over time. In addtion, growth mindset entails making sure not to give up early on tasks, but instead, upon hitting a roadblock, poke at them from multiple angles, and search for different approaches and perhaps talk through the issue to yourself, or others.

Some ways to ensure I have a growth mindset:

1:Making sure that this computer is not used for anything other than work. This location that I am at is My Office, and there are no distractions here.
2:Keep up to date each day with changes to the 4 pinned website tabs that cover my work for this Code 102 class. Perhaps set a specific time to check in.
3:Be willing to talk to others. Communication may have been the focus of my degree, but it is for the reason that it is hard for me. Being able to talk to others to ask for help, and communicate confusion or stopping points is vital to working on a team, and is a fundamental skill for programming jobs in my future.

### Jekyll Themes
