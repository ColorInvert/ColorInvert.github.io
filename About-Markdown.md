# About Markdown.

### Markdown files (file extension .md) are a file format for making very simple, primarily text-focused web pages.

Markdown allows you to **bold** or *italicize* phrases on your page simply through placing 2, or 1 astrisks on both sides of your text respectively, in addition to allowing various types of headings and formatting options.

The headlines above are made using varous numbers of # placed before your line of text. More #s means smaller title, from 1 to 6 #s.

Some other examples of markdown features are

> Quoted text, which is made by including a > at the start of your line.

```
code display formatting, created by making three ` before and after your block of text,
will maintain all of your text formatting without applying any effects to them,
allowing you to have text **like this** that does not end up bolded.

##### Markdown is very useful for getting simple text formatting onto a webpage in a hurry, and should be quite familiar to anyone who uses Slack or Discord, which have their own version of Markdown-like formatting shortcuts.
