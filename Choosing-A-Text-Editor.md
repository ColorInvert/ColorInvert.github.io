# Choosing a text editor



##### While picking a text editor may seem like a daunting task, it ultimately boils down to personal preference, as many text editors intended for coding share many features with each other.


A few of the things that a code-focused text editor will tend to provide you with include:

- Some degree of automated formatting, such as automatic indentation for nested commands, creating brackets, commas, and parentheses for you, and other such things.
- Context-aware color highlighting of text, which is known as **Syntax Highlighting** where certain types of segments of your code, such as integers, or variables, or arguments are given their own color coding, to make them identifiable at a glance.
- Color customization, and font size/choice options for the editor itself, which are often called **Themes** including glorious, eye-strain-relieving **darkmode.**
- Support for **Extensions** which are additional modifications to the text editor that you can apply for added features and assists, depeding on the type of work you do, or what languages you tend to work in.

Computers also come with a text editor, but it's generally not recommended to use those for the sake of programming. You will be missing out on all of the features listed above, and the editor itself will not make any attempts to assist you or recognize and autofill commands.

A Text Editor is different from an **Integrated Development Environment.** (IDE) An IDE has features for file management, debugging, and compiling, so IDEs are recommended only if you know precisely what you will be working, and deploying, in terms of language and final product.

The Git editor for assembling markdown pages on-site is in itself a text editor as well, albiet a rather rudimentary one.
