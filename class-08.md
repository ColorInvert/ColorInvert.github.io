#### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
Flexbox is made for elements that are either all in a row next to each other, or all in a column above and below each other. Flexbox is not intended, and does not well support, items that are layed out in a grid.

#### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
The main axis is the primary direction that elements will be placed and resized in accordance to, which can be either vertical or horizontal. The cross axis is simply the perpendicular direction, the one you are not using as your primary flex direction.

#### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
Flexbox is not well supported on older internet browsers, and thus will not display properly, if at all, on them. In addition, flexbox can be used to re-order elements, but ONLY VISUALLY. Internally, and what is seen by screen readers, will be in the original order, leading to confusion with arrowkey navigation.


#### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
Flexbox makes it very easy to make multiple lined-up segments of a webpage be precisely the same size, and precisely the same distance from each other, no matter what size or orientation the screen viewing it is.

#### How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
Every tool at my disposal helps. Learning new insights into CSS can help me make professional and fancy looking webpages, which gives me better odds of impressing clients, or interviewers for jobs.
